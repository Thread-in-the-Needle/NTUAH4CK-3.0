# Christmas Confession

### Description
I opened my inbox today and came across this weird "Card.xlsx". I think this might be some kind of confession from a secret fan.

Unfortunately I just found out that the secret message is displayed in the same color as the card... As if that was not enough, the sheet is protected too. 
Please help me find out who my secret admirer is!!

**Notes**

Wrap the flag in NH4CK{}

The file is not malicious so you can open it on your main PC if you want.

In order for the flag to be displayed correctly, viewing the file in Microsoft or Libre Office is recommended.

# Browser_Password

I forgot an important password that i use in a secret environment i must access. I remembered that i had save that password to my friend's chrome browser. When i informed them about that they told me that they couldn't retrieve the plaintext password but they read the other day an article saying that there is a way to get the plaintext of stored passwords in a browser. Sadly they didn't have time to do that for me so they sent me some files that will help me achieve that.
